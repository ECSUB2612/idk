I know the content inside the apps page is probably blocked i will try and get those working as soon as possible as i dont currently have any domains/proxys around them yet 
because i have to use a different domain/proxy for big apps like youtube and all. Also if games get restricted press the launch in about blank button wich should unblock games unfortunately
abut blank dosent work with the content in the apps page. if games are restricted then try pressing the about blank button in the top left of the home page then relaunch the game if this does not work then i dont know.
